# WORK IN PROGRESS
# Welcome to the TLS Practical Repository  

This repository is for the **Advanced Remote Sensing TLS Practical** at **UGent**.  

## What You'll Learn  

In this practical, you will:  
- Gain an understanding of **what point cloud data is** and how to process it.  
- Use **the RayCloudTools library** to perform instance segmentation on a plot point cloud.  
- Use **the RayCloudTools library** to perform 3D modelling on tree point clouds.  
- Use **ITSMe** to calculate structural metrics from tree point clouds.  

This repository contains all the necessary files to **successfully complete the practical**.

## How to Get Started  

1. **Open the notebooks**  
   - The notebooks are marked in order (0X_notebookname.file). With this README file being the first. If you follow all files one by one, everything should make sense.

2. **Set up your data**  
   - Save the **[data folder](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/tree/main/DATA)** to your **Google Drive** under:  
     ```
     My Drive/Colab Notebooks/TLS_course/data
     ```

3. **Follow the L2B notebook instructions**  
   - Launch the **[L2B notebook](https://github.com/gdeslo/GEDI_course/blob/main/04_GEDI_L2B_notebook.ipynb)** in **Google Colab**.
      - Google Colab may show the following error. Simply click "Authorize."
